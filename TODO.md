# TODO

* Update the oAuth system to consider member banned status
* Investigate proper oAuth protocol
* Enable cache for Doctrine (for production only)
* Slim out bootstrap, by removing unused components and their dependencies (eg: dropdown requires popper.js)
* Bug: Don't destroy the session for bad routes (the authentication service)

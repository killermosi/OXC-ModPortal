; Directory where to cache mod images. Can be set to "null" to disable caching (NOT recommended in production).
; Additionally, a symlink named "mod-image" to the cache directory can be created in the application's "public"
; directory (or the cache directory can be directly defined there), so that Apache will serve the cached images
; without having them processed by the application. Will be created automatically if possible.
; Must be an absolute path.

; Should be set to a directory that is automatically cleaned by the system (like /tmp).
; Will be created automatically if possible. Must be an absolute path.
